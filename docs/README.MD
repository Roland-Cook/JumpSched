## Project Documentation

Please put any and all documentation for your project in this folder. Other than the documents that are required at the end of week 13, feel free to organize this however your group sees fit.

We created a full stack app that allows users to sign-up for skyidives. WE created some other pages for the site that display pricing, common questions, and a gallery on a carousel.
The team also created components that allow users to create an account, view the manifests for a given day. We also thought it a good idea to create a profile for the user that allows them to cancel their jumps, or finish their jumps depending. The completed jumps will display a list of only "completed" jumps. WE have plans to add further functionaility that include an admin role that can cancel/finish jumps from the manifest menu that allows for more precise manifest keeping. We would like to add the ability for admin to upload pictures/videos to the gallery, but that would require further functionality on that page. We would like to extend this function to the profile page so that other users can see pictures and videos posted from specific users.
